    Background Color: Soft Off-White (#F5F5F5) – for a clean and minimalistic background.
    Button Colors: Neon Blue (#00BCD4) for call-to-action buttons to make them stand out.

        Cards with vibrant icons to represent different features like "Manage Exams", "Student Dashboard", "Results", etc.
        Hover effects with neon colors for interactivity.

        Smooth transitions for hover effects, buttons, and modal windows.
        Use AOS (Animate on Scroll) library for scroll animations.
        Interactive charts with Chart.js or ApexCharts to visualize data.
